Mediathek
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Nils HÃ¶rrmann (post@nilshoerrmann.de)
Build Date: 16th February 2009
Requirements: Symphony 2.0


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the "mediathek" folder in this archive to your Symphony "extensions" folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Mediathek", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Mediathek" field to your sections.


[UPDATE]

1. Deleted the old "mediathek" folder in your Symphony "extensions" folder and replace it with the new one in this archive.

2. Update your database by enabling the "Field: Mediathek" under "Extensions" in your Symphony backend (see installation, section 2).

3. IMPORTANT: Go to each section that uses a "Mediathek" field and resave it. Otherwise the extension will stop working!

4. PLEASE NOTE: Be aware that due to some changes in the data source output (see change log) your XSL templates will need some tender, love and care.
